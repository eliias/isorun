# Types

There are a couple of types that are interoperable between JavaScript and Ruby.
This list might be extended in the future. Types that nest other types (Array,
Hash, â€¦) are also supported. There is no built-in limit, but keep in mind that
conversion of types is not for free and that you might pollute the stack when
having heavy recursion calls.

| bool    | Boolean         |
| String  | String          |
| Float   | Number          |
| Integer | Number          |
| FixNum  | Number          |
| Struct  | Object          |
| Array   | Array           |
| Hash    | Object          |
